# MVC in ES6

This project will show a very simple relation between Model-View-Controller.
Where I let the Controller observer the view for input. This is done, so all the View-ish binding are actually in the View (Where View data will be send to the observer).

The *src* folder will contain the actual ES6 code, where *build* contains the compiled code (Compiled with `babel` and `browserify`).
